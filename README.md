# Summary

In this project, I have created a personal website with a Cyberpunk theme. The website showcases my skills and projects as a Junior Software Developer specializing in back-end and audio technologies. Here is a summary of the key features and functionalities implemented:

## Cyberpunk Theme
The website features a dark Cyberpunk theme with neon colors and glitch effects. The CSS styles are designed to create a visually appealing and modern look.

## Interactive Elements
- **Image Hover Effect**: The profile image has a hover effect that slightly enlarges the image, adding a dynamic touch to the design.
- **Glitch Text Animation**: The main heading uses a glitch animation to create a futuristic effect.

## Chatbot Integration
A simple chatbot is integrated into the website, allowing users to interact and get links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and CV. The chatbot can be toggled on and off with a button.

## Sound Effects
Clicking on buttons triggers a sound effect, enhancing the user experience with auditory feedback.

## Spotify Integration
A button is provided to play a Spotify track. When clicked, the Spotify player is displayed, and the track starts playing automatically.

## Downloadable CV
A button is available for users to download my CV directly from the website.

## External Links
Links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles are provided, allowing visitors to connect with me on professional platforms.

Overall, the website combines modern web design techniques with interactive elements to create an engaging and informative personal portfolio.
